# School Library

> This is basic school library app that has been built with Ruby. The app allows for some basic operations  for example getting the name of the student or the teacher as well as constraints that come with their age.

The app will allow you to:

- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
- And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way!
